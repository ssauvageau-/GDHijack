I am NOT liable for any damage you cause to your mods or your computer with this code.

This code was written for a 1920x1080 monitor at 100% magnification (standard) on Windows 7. Timings were made for read operations from a Solid State Drive; if you're using a Hard Disk Drive, you may need to adjust the Robot delay and Thread sleep times accordingly.
