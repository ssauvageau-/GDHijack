I am NOT liable for any damage you cause to your mods or your computer with this code.

This code was written for a 1920x1080 monitor at 100% magnification (standard) on Windows 7. Timings were made for read operations from a Solid State Drive; if you're using a Hard Disk Drive, you may need to adjust the Robot delay and Thread sleep times accordingly.

# Usage

Edit the "int[] mods = {5, 6};" line (line 11) in Main.java to an array of whichever mods you want to automatically compile via the Asset Manager. There's probably a limit to the highest mod ID, but I don't have any clue what it is. Should work up to about 40 at least. A mod ID in this program is defined as its placement on the Mod->Select dropdown menu, with 0 being None, 1 being immediately after None, etc. 

Then run the code however you like to run Java code.

Am I making a UI for this? Hellno.
